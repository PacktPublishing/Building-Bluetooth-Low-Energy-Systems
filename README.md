# Building Bluetooth Low Energy Systems

This is the code repository for [Building Bluetooth Low Energy Systems](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/building-bluetooth-low-energy-systems?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786461087), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a Wireless Personal Area network technology aimed at novel applications for smart devices. High-tech BLE profiles and services are being increasingly used by application developers and hardware enthusiasts to allow devices to interact with the surrounding world.
This book will focus on a technical introduction to BLE and how it is reshaping small-distance communication. We will start with IoT, where many technologies such as BLE, Zigbee, and IEEE 802.15.4 Mesh will be introduced. The book will present BLE from an engineering perspective, from which the protocol stack, architecture, and layers are discussed. You will learn to implement customized projects for Peripheral/Central communication, BLE Beacons, indoor navigation using triangulation, and the Internet gateway for Bluetooth Low Energy Personal Network, all using various code samples and APIs on Android, iOS, and the Web. Finally, the book will conclude with a glimpse into future technologies destined to be prominent in years to come.

## Instructions and Navigation

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter03.



The code will look like the following:
```
List<BluetoothGattCharacteristic> gattCharacteristics =
                service.getCharacteristics();
        // Loops through available Characteristics.
        for (BluetoothGattCharacteristic gattCharacteristic :
                gattCharacteristics) {
            // Do something with gattCharacteristic
        }
```
